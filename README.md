# 🐍 Python Projects

A collection of my Python work—from early coursework and scripting exercises to more advanced tools focused on automation, networking, and cybersecurity.

---

## 🧠 Project Progression

This repo reflects my growth as a developer:
- 📘 **Beginner Projects** – Basic scripts from school like calculators, file readers, and logic-based programs
- 🛠️ **Intermediate Builds** – More structured scripts using functions, classes, and libraries like `requests`, `argparse`, and `socket`
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity Tools** – Scripts for recon, automation, and system interaction (e.g., port scanners, VPN checkers, and CLI bots)

---

## 💼 Notable Topics
- Scripting for networking tasks (ping sweepers, ARP scanners)
- API interaction (OpenAI, Discord bots)
- File parsing & log analysis
- System automation with Python & Bash hybrids

---

## 📁 Structure (Coming Soon)
Each project will include:
- Purpose & description
- Instructions on how to run it
- Screenshots or terminal output
- Future improvements (for continuous growth)

---

## 🌱 Always Learning
I constantly revisit older code to refactor, optimize, or upgrade it with new techniques. My goal is to turn simple scripts into powerful, scalable tools over time.
